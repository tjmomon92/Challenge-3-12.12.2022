# <Challenge #3 - 12.12.2022>

## Description

This challenge was difficult, but was so much fun to find and apply all of the intricacies in the script. My goal in this project was not only to ensure the program was accessible and easy to follow, but also to make the actual script itself as simple to read as possible to be used as reference as I continue in the course. This project was a fantastic exercise not only in javaScript, but also in examining a real-world solution to small inconveniences that can be optimized. A quick and easy password generator can simplify the process of high-security logins; (after all, everyone LOVES the "Please update your password" messages). I believe that seeing examples such as this will help me to see opportunities to create new applications and extend my knowledge and skillset. My biggest takeaway from this project was the implementation of intricate if/else statements to validate multiple options for generating passwords. It was an enjoyable test of my logical skillset to take into account all potential options that could come up while using the program. Overall, I feel that this project accelerated my growth significantly, and will be an important tool in my toolkit going forward.
